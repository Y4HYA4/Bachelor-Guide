# When You Are Done 

There will come a time when your report comes to an end. You may also decide that it is now the time for just that.

At that exact point, <br>
**You'll have to print it**.

There is a good place around you just for that. Take your content converted it to PDF. 

Don't say you don't know how.<br>
I showed you [exactly how](../learntex.md).


- Get out of [technopole (2/2)](https://isticampus.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/navigator/round/7-step-to-techno-pole.png) to the right-front.
- Take it [in USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB) or via email to the following.



<div align="center">

## Sola Print!

## HAVE IT THIS WAY.

## PLZZ NOT THIS!

 </div>


You will also need a CD, as discussed. 

This same place where you just printed your report can also serve it for you.

- Take them to college library.


And again, if you feel lost, you can always [get back and learn more](../pfe.md).

That's with the above process.<br>
Great to see your speed.

Now proceed with the following to get some knowledge.
