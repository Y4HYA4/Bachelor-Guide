## The Spectacle of Academic Culmination

I will be taking this chance to outline for you the entire process and the social interactions that must be fulfilled in order to get out with a great experience and a lasting memory. Wether you believe it or not, memories make the man and I want you to have more good of that.

After the years spent doing the program, your last exams should be accomplished by a january of a given year.

From this point and beyond please...
- Satisfy the univeristy administration documents.
- Start or continue working on [your end of study project](learntex?id=action-required).

Considering the papers you have to validate with college. You should be more aware of these after [your summer intern](intern.md).

Let me kindly re-step the process in a better way.

- Deposit an amount to the postal service and save the receipt.<br>
- Take an agreement from your administration and others to company.

**What To Expect:**
- The head of deparment¹ will assign you a mentor² from university side.
- The company executives³ will assign you another mentor⁴ from the org side.

These people are very important to you and I must highlight the importance of focusing and following their instructions carefully.

After doing works, 4 months later, that day will come.
But before, you must deposit your project report.

Make a memorable printable copy to each of those great people¹⁻⁷.

- You will defend your work in front of the president⁵ and the rapporteur⁶.
- Your mentors²﹐⁴ will stand by your side, ready to protect it alongside you.

Prepare a presentation tell the key findings of your intensive report doing real works.

- Expect to recieve and act on the feedback of the defense day.
- Make the changes needed, report to the rapporteur.

Once this day and those that follow are fulfilled.

- [x] You succeeded on your Defense Day.
- [x] You followed the feedback.
- [x] You had your work validated.

You are ready to proceed to the next step.
- Deliver the final product to the library.
- Make a digital copy to a CD and take both.
