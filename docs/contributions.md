### 🤔 Why are we doing this?
Knowledge should be accessible to everyone. 

Everyone deserves the opportunity to learn and grow, no matter their background or circumstances. 

Knowledge can open up so many doors for you, to explore new possibilities and develop skills that could help you in life.

It is tough to find the right material when preparing for an exam. I know that struggle all too well.

Our goal is to gather as much useful information as we possibly can. 

That is why we ask for your help.
