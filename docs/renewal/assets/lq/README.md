## Balancing Quality and Speed

I reduced both the size and quality of the assets to improve their loading speed and ensure they appear promptly on user direction.

Previously, loading assets in the directory took a considerable amount of time, potentially causing frustration for some users, despite the high-quality results being worth the wait.

This directory is specifically designated for lower-quality assets.
