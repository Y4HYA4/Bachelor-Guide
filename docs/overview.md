**Is it right for you?**

- Future-proof career: The demand for IT professionals like you is expected to continue growing
- Versatile skills: Comprehensive skill set that allows you to adapt to changing tech
- Lucrative earning potential: Companies are willing to invest more and more in top talent

You can now decide.

ðŸŽ¯ Let's jump on this exciting journey together and discover the fascinating world of information technology!

# Empowering Students

This guide aims to complement your Computer Engineering degree by introducing you to a range of remarkable innovations that the world is constantly leveraging to provide value incl. web, mobile development, computer architecture, security, embedded systems, cloud computing, and software testing.

**TL;DR** The content presented does not carry any official affiliation or rights from the designated institution.

Instead, it represents a collaborative endeavor by individuals committed to delivering information, resources and help you level up.

# Path to options

In terms of your degree, you have 5 semesters total. After 2 semesters, the student should be able to select one of two specialties for the remaining three semesters.

This will enable the pursuer to concentrate their studies on a specific area and gain more knowledge in that domain.

- IOT & Embedded systems (IOT)
- Network and Systems Engineering (IRS)

> ISTIC used to assign students with higher grades to IOT; This could imply that IOT is the best option. It is not. Both paths are excellent.
