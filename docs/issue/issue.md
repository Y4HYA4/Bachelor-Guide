1. Start with the base URL for creating a new issue in your repository:
```
https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name/issues/new
```
Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your repository.

2. Add the `title` parameter to set the issue title (optional):

```
?title=Your%20Issue%20Title
```

Replace `Your%20Issue%20Title` with the desired title for the issue. If you don't want to pre-fill the title, you can omit this parameter.

3. Add the `body` parameter to set the issue description (custom message):

```
&body=Your%20custom%20message%20here
```

Replace `Your%20custom%20message%20here` with the message you want to pre-fill in the issue description.

4. Here's the complete URL with both the title and body parameters:
```
https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name/issues/new?title=Your%20Issue%20Title&body=Your%20custom%20message%20here
```
When users click on this URL, it will take them to the "New Issue" page in your repository with the title and custom message pre-filled. 

Remember to replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name, and customize the title and message as needed.



To exemplify this idea, let's begin with a call to the base URL and easy query parameters for the body only.

* **Base URL:** `https://github.com/yaya2devops/bachelor-guide/issues/new` - This is the base URL of the GitHub repository where the issue is being created.

[Yaya Ask For Your feedback here]

```sh
https://github.com/yaya2devops/bachelor-guide/issues/new?title=&body=%0A%0A%5BYaya%20Ask%20For%20Your%20feedback%20here%5D%0A%0A%0A
```


Best, consider passing additional data in the parameters  and deliver a query of a sophisticated nature.


* **Query Parameters:**
   1. Set the title of the new issue to "Let Us Know."
   2. Set an interesting body content for the issue e.g. for guide details and additional information related to the issue, including IDs, content details, source, service, and GitHub handle.

```sh
https://github.com/yaya2devops/bachelor-guide/issues/new?title=Let%20Us%20Know&body=%0A%0A%5BYaya%20Ask%20For%20Your%20feedback%20here%5D%0A%0A%0A---%0A%23%23%23%23%20Guide%20Details%0A%E2%9A%A0%20*Leave%20This%20section%20for%20GitHub%20and%20Guide%20issue%20redirections*%0A*%20ID%3A%20%5B7e2c0e6e-8b6d-4c2f-aaef-15f736a7b2a1%5D%0A*%20Version%20Independent%20ID%3A%20%5Ba5f1d387-7be9-4f0c-b92d-d52d16ef1d8e%5D%0A*%20Content%3A%20%5BBachelors%20in%20Computer%20Engineering%20Guide%5D%0A*%20Content%20Source%3A%20%5Bbachelor-guide/docs/README.md%5D(https://github.com/yaya2devops/bachelor-guide/blob/main/docs/README.md)%0A*%20Service%3A%20%5Bcollege-students-empower%5D%0A*%20GitHub%20Handle%3A%20%40yaya2devops
 ```

The URL will simplify the process of creating a new issue for users.
