## ðŸ“– Graphs & Optimization

Graphs & Optimization delve into probabilistic models, real random variables, and continuous random variables to uncover hidden patterns in unpredictable scenarios.

- Probabilistic Models
- Real Random Variables
- Continuous Random Variables

Despite being challenging, understanding these concepts is crucial for leveraging the full potential of this subject.

---

## ðŸ“– Statistical Probabilities

Dive into Probabilistic Models, Unveil the hidden patterns in unpredictable scenarios, dissect the behavior of Real Random Variables and much more.

- Probabilistic Models
- Real Random Variables
- Continuous Random Variables

Most students hate this subject not knowing the actual potential it hides.

Don't be most people.

## ðŸ“– Industrial Local Area Networks

Welcome to the lovely subject of the millions if not the billions.

Networking is in everything and everything is networking. 

- Local Networks: General Presentation
- The OSI Model
- The Ethernet LAN Technology Standard
- Industrial Local Area Networks

Get the most out of this and always learn more.

## ðŸ“– Multimedia Technologies

Here you will get into the origin of the pictures you took via the modern iphone or you spend your entire day swipping on instagram.

- Introduction to Multimedia
- Treatment of Multimedia Data: The Sound Signal
- Treatment of Multimedia Data: The Pictures


Too much calculations but so much worth it for the foundation of today quality.

## ðŸ“– Unified Modeling Language(UML) 

Information Technology is all about presenting an idea to people and getting their validation.

This is the basic building block to visuals. You'll learn how to see things connected, connect yours and innovate.

- User Case Diagram
- Class Case Diagram
- Sequence Case Diagram

I used sequence case diagram just yesterday in a job interview submission to highlight the process of CICD.

## ðŸ“– Foundations of Databases

You see things but can you interact with them? Can you sign up and having your credentials saved somewhere safe?

Whatever is happening other that what you just see needs a database and that's why this subject is in place.

You'll learn it in a very structured approach to end up an SQL master.

- Introduction to Databases
- Entity-Association (EA) Model
- ModÃ¨le Relationnel et Passage EA-Relationnel
- SQL: Definition Language of Data (LDD)
- SQL: Langage de Manipulation des DonnÃ©es (LMD)
- SQL: Data Control Language (LCD)

Once done, you can go try things like hosting a wordpress? or deploy a ghost application with an external SQL system like Google MySQL? Or AWS RDS.

The choice is yours but also, get this on school right.

> SQL : Structured Query Language

## ðŸ“– Object Oriented Programming (OOP in JaVa).

POO is a more advanced way to coding and you need to implement it. We did it in cpp, other friends in iot did it with cpp.

Both cute, learn coding the right way.
- Introduction to Java
- Basic Elements of Java
- Heritage
- Interfaces in Java

Make greater assurance to give C a great time prior.

---

## ðŸ“– Python Coding Workshop
More coding, the top tier language on earth.

Very easy, very powerful and get so much shit done.

- Introduction to Python
- Basics: Variables, Types, Control Structures, Iterative Structures
- Python Control Structures
- Standard Containers in Python
- Python Functions
- The Files
- Object Oriented Python

You can consider python for fulltime and make your life bet on it.

---

## ðŸ“– Signal transmission

Dive deeper into the intricacies of network data transfer. 

- General Information on Transmissions
- Signal Transmission (Analog)
- Signal Transmission (Analog-Digital)

Expand your understanding of how information flows across networks through a more intensive exploration.

---

## ðŸ“– Antennas and transmission lines

An Overview on Antenneas and how they realy works.

- General Information on Radio Transmissions
- Characteristics of Antennae

intresting topic to understand data transfer over short and long distances.

---

## ðŸ“– English
I love english and I think you should too.

- Word Processing
- GUI Operating Systems
- Spreadsheets and Databases

I love english and I think you should too again.


---


## ðŸ“– Business Management

An excellent approach to better understand proper behavior within a specific setting.

- The Company and Its Environment
- Management and Manager
- The Management Process
- Business Functions

Learn those lessons that you will apply later on.
